MUTEX
pthread_mutex_t is the variable type of mutex
Initially it contains garbage value
pthread_mutex_init initializes mutex to 0
pthread_mutex_lock and pthread_mutex_unlock for locking mechanism

SEMAPHORE
declared as sem_t variable

##Unnamed Semaphore (for thread of the same process)
stored in global variables
sem_init() used to initialise the semaphore
initially it is garbage
init makes it zero
sem_init takes as argument sem_t, pshared indicating whether sema is shared bw processes or threads(0) and semaphore initial value
sem_wait, sem_post to down/up semaphore value
sem_destroy to destroy the semaphore

##Named Semaphore (for different processes)
stored in shared memory
sem_open takes sema name, create/exclusive flag, 0777 mode, value and return sem_t *
sem_wait/sem_post just as above
sem_unlink to remove the name of semaphore
sem_close to close the semaphore (allocated resources are freed)
