ps -xal

UID = User name/id of the process owner
F = flags
PID
PPID
PRI = Priority
NI = Nice value
VSZ = Virtual memory usage (Total memory of the process including swap, allocated but not used memory)
RSS = Resident Set Size (portion of process memory held in main memory)
TIME = Amount of CPU time used by the process
COMMAND = Name of the process alongwith the arguments
STAT = Process State (Comprises of state codes and attributes)
	State Codes:-
		D - Uninterruptible Sleep, executing uninterruptible system calls (eg:- mkdir)
			cannot kill a process in this state
		R - Running or Runnable
		S - Interruptible Sleep (I/O), (waiting for event)
		T - Stopped by job control signal or being traced
			job - It is a process group (eg:- grep apt | sort | less)
			job control - allows user to move between processes in a single session(terminal)
			Traced state is when process is stopped using SIGSTOP
		Z - Zombie (defunct) terminated but not reaped
		
	keywords:-
		< - high priority
		N - low priority
		s - session leader (we use group id and session id so that it becomes easy to identify related processes)
				It makes it easy to kill all piped processes when exiting terminal
		l - is multithreaded
		+ - is in the foreground process group
		
WCHAN = Memory address of the kernel function the process is sleeping in (Waiting Channel)	
		
Notes:-
	Ctrl^z sends SIGSTOP, fg/bg send SIGCONT
	tty is a terminal device
	pts is a pseudo terminal device (terminal device emulated by a xterm or shell or ssh)
	If we want to see implementations of c libraries we need source code as linux contains precompiled libraries (shared object)
	
	ptrace:- allows tracer to observe and control the execution of tracee
		While being traced, tracee will stop each time a signal is recieved
		
	Sometimes process arguments are unavailable(kernel daemons), then ps prints these processes in square brackets
