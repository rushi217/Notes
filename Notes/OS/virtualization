Creating software based versions of resources
Why is it used:
	Server consolidation:
		physical servers are underutilized, so waste energy
		instead run many VMs on single server to improve utilisation
		VMs are easy to move around on different machines
	Desktop Virtualization:
		Testing/using different types of software
		Avoid need for different hardware for different OSes
	Security Testing:
		Isolate and contain malicious software
    
Type 1:
	run directly on bare metal(hardware)
	like native OS
	does not provide generic syscalls
	Vmware esxi
Type 2:
	Runs within OS
	runs like an application
	commonly for desktops
  
Modern CPU provide special hardware and instruction for virtualization
	Intel VT-x
Hypervisor does 3 hardware functions:
	Virtualize memory management
		guest virtual memory mapped to physical memory
		Modern CPU provide extended Memory Management Unit for hypervisor
		Hypervisor sets up initial memory layout
			bootloader
			Hardware devices
			interrupt vector table
	CPU instructions:
		Intercepts and Handles privileged instructions
			safe instructions are allowed
			cpu generates trap (hardware exception)  when unsafe instructions are encountered (VM enter)
			Hypervisor intercepts this trap and handles it and returns control to guest OS (VM exit)	
	Manage I/O:
		Hypervisor intercepts memory mapped I/O instructions and virtualizes interrupt controller
		CPU generate trap when I/O instruption detected
		Trap intercepted by hypervisor (VM enter)
		hypervisor interacts with host OS then returns to guest OS(VM exit)
