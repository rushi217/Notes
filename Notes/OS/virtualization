Creating software based versions of resources
Why is it used:
  Server consolidation:
    physical servers are underutilized, so waste energy
    instead run many VMs on single server to improve utilisation
    VMs are easy to move around on different machines
  Desktop Virtualization:
    Testing/using different types of software
    Avoid need for different hardware for different OSes
  Security Testing:
    
    
Type 1:
  run directly on bare metal(hardware)
  like native OS
  does not provide generic syscalls
  Vmware esxi
Type 2:
  Runs within OS
  runs like an application
  commonly for desktops
