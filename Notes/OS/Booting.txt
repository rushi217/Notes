1. Power On is pressed.

2. Every register initialized to 0 except Code Segment(CS) and Instruction Pointer(IP).

3. CS = 0xf000 IP = 0xfff0

4. Bios Address = (CS)<<<4 + IP = 0xffff0 At this address bios ROM is connected in processor address space

5. Bios then:
	test the system.
	initialize pci and pcie (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) devices and puts them in cpu address space.
	Identifies the boot device (OS)
	Read sector 0 from boot device and load in 0x7c00 location in RAM.
	
6. SEctor 0 is called the Master Boot Record.

7. MBR loads the bootloader (small program) after looking at the partition table.

8. Bootloader loads the OS.

9. Bootloader also:
	Allows user to select which OS to load.
	Setup GDT(Global Descriptor Table).
	Read OS into the RAM.
	
10. During Booting CPU operates in Real Mode.

11. In real mode:
	Only 20 bit(1MB) addressable space is available.
	Bios, MBR, peripherals are put in this address space.
	
12. Just before loading OS, CPU shifts to protected mode.

13. Sometimes MBR may be absent, Bootloader is present in Sector 0.

14. In multiprocessor system one of the processor is designated as boot processor.

15. Boot processsor then starts other processors(Application Processors) using Startup Inter Processor Interrupt.
