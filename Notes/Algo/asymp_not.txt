Notation:
	1. Big Oh (O) = upper bound (worst case)
					f(n) <= c*g(n), for n >= n0, c > 0, n0 >= 1
	
	2. Big Omega (Om) = lower bound
						f(n) >= c*g(n), for n >= n0, c > 0, n0 >= 1
						
	3. Big Theta (Ot) = upper and lower bound
						c1*g(n) <= f(n) <= c2*g(n), for n >= n0, c1,c2 > 0, n0 >= 1
	
	Relationship between stopping condition and number of iterations necessary to reach the condition gives worst case
	
	No need to unroll if each loop executes independently
	
	If loops depend on each other, the we have have to unroll (create a summation equation)
