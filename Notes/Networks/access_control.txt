Collision in broadcast channel due to multiple senders
Techniques:-
	TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)
		cycle period = Tt + Tp
		useful period = Tt
		efficiency = Tt / (Tt + Tp)
	
	Polling
		Assign TDM slot after polling only if sender wants to send
		cycle period = Tpoll + Tt + Tp
		
	CSMA/CD
		Carrier Sensing Multiple Access / Collision Detection
		Before sending the data, sender senses the carrier
		If carrier is free you can send the data
		No ACK in LANs so collision cannot be detected easily
		Senders cannot tell if the collision signal is due to their packets
		So we keep frame length long enough such that, if there is a collision during Tt sender knows that it is due its packet
		If collision happens at one of the ends the sender detects collision after 2*Tp
		so Tt > 2*Tp
			L/BW > 2/Tp
			L > 2*Tp*BW So length of the packet must be greater than 2*Tp*BW
		efficiency = Tt / (c*2*Tp + Tt + Tp)	c = number of collisions
		
		Probality of success = Prob that only one station send
							= nC1 p * (1-p)^(n-1)
		Problem is that after detection both senders might start transmission at the same time
		This leads to collision again
		So we use backoff algorithm (01 or 10) using Tslot
