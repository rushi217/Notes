Distance Vector Routing:-
	Distance - cost (hops) of sending packet from a node to other node
	Networks can be represented as undirected graphs
	Vector - vector of distances from a node to other nodes (initially nodes that are not connected directly have distance infinity)
	After initial populting of dv's, nodes exchange dv's with neighbors
	Nodes create new routing tables from exchanged tables
	
Count to infinity problem:-
	If a link is down, the immediate node will know about it
	But the next neighbour will say that it has a finite distance to the down node
	This is because the dvr has no record to the nodes that you need to pass through to get to the down node
	"Good news travels fast bad news travles slow"
	It creates packet loops
	
Split Horizon:-
	If a node depends on another node to reach somewhere, we should not help that node
	B wants to know about A from me, but i send to A from B so i do not help B
	I send infinity to B so that that B does not depend on me
	This helps Count to infinity to converge faster

Link State Routing:-
	Link State is transfered instead of Distance vector
	Link state is similar to dv
	Using Link state a node creates the entire network
	This is global information
	Sequence number to keep track of latest packet
	TTL to avoid a packet falling in loop
	Distance to neighbors
