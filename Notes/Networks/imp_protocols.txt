ARP:-
	Address Resolution Protocol
	Used to discover MAC address using IP address
	Request - Response protocol
	Link layer packet structure:-
		HTYPE - 1 for ethernet
		PTYPE - ARP or IPv4
		HLEN - Hardware address length (6 for ethernet)
		PLEN - Upper protocol address length (4 for IPv4)
		Operation - 1 for request, 2 for reply
		Sender Hardware Address - used to populate mac table and arp table of reciever
		Sender Protocol Address
		Target Hardware Address - During ARP request this is set to broadcast mac address
		Target Protocol Address
	Host system tries to find mac address of the next hop in the table
	If it finds, it gives the address back to caller
	If it does not then the ARP is carried out
	
IP:-
	Internet Protocol
	Deliver packets from source to destination hosts using only IP addresses
	Unreliable, connectionless protocol
	Best effort delivery - does not guarantee delivery
	Packet Switching - data is divided into packets and delivered across network
		Each packet can take different route
	Circuit Switching - dedicated communication is established between 2 nodes
	IP Packet Structure:-
		Version - 4 or 6
		Length - Length of IP header (5 or 6)
		Total length - Header + data
		Identifier, flags, fragmentation offset - used for fragmentation
		TTL - decremented by every router so that packet does not live infinitely
		Protocol - upper layer protocol
		Header Checksum - check for errrors
		Source and Destination IP address
		Options and padding
	IP fragmentation:-
		breaks packets into smaller fragments so that the packets can pass through a link with small MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)
		3 bit flags - Bit 0 reserved - must be zero
					  Bit 1 Dont Fragment - 0 for may fragment if needed, 1 for no fragmentation
					  	if packet cannot be delivered w/o fragmentation, it is discarded
					  Bit 2 More Fragments - 0 for indicating last fragment, 1 if more fragments are yet to come
		Identification field - To identify fragments of the same packet
		Fragmentation offset - indicates position of fragment in the orignal packet
		Sender host sets a unique Identification field for a source dextination protocol
		Last fragment contains More Fragments bit equal to orignal packet (This allows multi level fragmentation)
		
ICMP:-
	Internet Control Message Protocol
	Used by routers to send error messages and operational information
	It uses IP for messaging
	ICMP header starts after IP header
	Header format:-
		Type - Control message identifier
		code - additional info for control message
	used for ping, destination unreachable, redirection

UDP:-
	User Datagram Protocol
	Unreliable connectionless protocol
	Suitable for simple query response applications like DNS
	No retransmission delay
	Header Format:-
		Source/Destination port number - usually a well known port number if server
		Length - header + data (4 to 65535)
		Checksum - error checking
	Pseudo Header - 
		UDP is an end to end protocol, the checksum is end to end not hop by hop
		Source/Destination IP address are useful to TCP as well as IP
		So we cannot let IP change SA/DA
		The plan was to encrypt the UDP header (along with pseudo header) and leave SA/DA plain
		This protected from MITM as the middle guy changing SA will invalidate the checksum
		
TCP:-
	Reliable, Error checked, connection oriented protocol
	Reliability using Acknowledgements and Retransmission
	Congestion Control using various protocols
	Header Format:-
		source/destination port
		Sequence Number - If SYN flag is set, then this is the initial sequence number
			Else it is the accumulated sequence number
		ACK number - If ACK flag is set then this is the next sequence number the reciever is expecting
			First ACKs acknowledges each others Initial sequence numbers
		Data offset - size of tcp header in words (5 w/o options)
		Flags:-
			NS - Electronic Communication Network (ECN) nonce concealment protection
			CWR - Congestion Window Reduced, set by sender to indicate that it recieved a segment with ECE flag set
			ECE - ECN Echo
				If SYN is 1 - TCP peer is ECN capable
				SYN is 0 - indicates that segment experienced congestion (congestion indication)
			URG - indicates that urgent field is significant
			ACK - ACK number field is significant
			PSH - push buffered data to application
			RST - reset the connection
			SYN - synchronize sequence numbers
			FIN - last packet from sender
		Window size - size of recieve window
		Checksum
		Urgent pointer - is an offset to sequence number, which indicates the last urgent data byte
		Options - MSS, Window scaling, SACK permit, Timestamp
		
DNS:-
	Used to translate names into IP address
	If the translation does not exists in local cache the resolving name server goes to root server
	At the top exists the root server
	Root server gives the address of the TLD (Top Level Domain) name servers
	TLD gives address of the Authoritative name servers using Domain's registrar
	When a Domain is purchased, it is registered in the registrar
	ANS gives the ip address of the required website
	Records:-
		A record - Point Domain Name (FQDN) to IP address
		CNAME - Canonical name
			Single IP can have 2 different servers running on 2 different ports with different names
			When we change the IP address of the A record the change is reflected in each CNAME records
		MX record - Mail Exchange record
			Specifies Mail server that will recieves mail
			All mails to the example.com are directed to mail.example.com
	Round Robin Load Balancing - A records with different IP address are used in round robin fashion
