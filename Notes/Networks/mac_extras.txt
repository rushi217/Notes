CRC (cyclic redundancy check)
	sender and reciever exchange the CRC generator beforehand
	let gen size be n
	n-1 zeros are appended to the frame
	remainder is calculated and added to the frame after dividing with generator
	while checking at the reciever the remainder must be zero if the there is no error
	It is an error detection strat (retransmission after detection)

Checksum
	Assume 8 bit checksum (IP uses 16 bit)
	Header is divided into 8 bit sections
	Decimal equivalent of each 8 bit section is calculated and summed
	1's complement of the sum is calculated and stored in the checksum field
	While calculating the checksum is kept zero
	
Data is measured in powers of 2
BW is measured in powers of 10

Transmission delay is the time taken by the host to put the packet on the link
	Tt = packet_size / BW
Propagation delay is the time taken by the packet to traverse the link
	Tp = D/V (D = distance, V = speed)
Processing time and Queueing time at the reciever

Throughput (Bandwidth Utilization) = Total bits that can be sent per second
								   = L / Tt + 2*Tp , L = total number of bits sent
Efficiency (eta) = 1 / (1 + (2*Tp)/Tt) (Numerator is 1 for stop and wait)
Throughput = eta * BW
Capacity of the channel = BW * Tp (Total data that can be stored in the channel)
Maax number of packets that can be sent = 1 + 2 * (Tp/Tt)

Go Back N:-
	1. Sender window size is equal to N (N > 1, if N = 1 then it is stop and wait)
		eta = N / 1 + 2*a
	2. Reciever window size is 1
		It is called Go Back N because in case error sender goes back by N packets from the recently transmitted packet and transmits again
		This is because reciever discards packets not in order
		All the packets in the window are retransmitted
	3. It uses cumulative acknowledgements
		each packet has timeout timers
		Reciever has a ACK timer
		In each interval it ACKs all the packets recieved
	Sequence Numbers > sender window size + reciever window size
	
Selective Repeat:-
	1. Sender Window size > 1
	2. Reciever Window size = sender window size
	3. Send Negative ACK for corrupted packets
