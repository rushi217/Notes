Open Systems Interconnection

Physical layer:-
	Information in form of bits
	Provides synchronization using clock
	limits transmission rate
	Defines network topology
	defines transmission mode (simplex, duplex)
	Encoding and decoding functions that transform bits to signals
	Techniques:-
		NRZ - 1 by +ve voltage, 0 by -ve voltage
		RZ - 0 by 0 voltage	
		Both techniques are not self clocking, so they require clocking
		Now this requires 2 channels
		Manchester encoding - exor of data and clock signals
	
Datalink layer:-
	Node to node delivery of frame
	divided into 2 sublayers:-
		Logical link control - frame synchronization, flow control, error checking
		Media Access control - Addressing mechanism and channel access control
		
Network layer:-
	Transmission of packets from one host to another
	Routing - selecting shortest path to transmit packet
	Unique logical addressing
	
Transport layer:-
	Appplication to application delivery of segments
	Flow and error control
	Accepts message from session layer and divides it into segments
	Service point addressing
	Connection oriented and connection less service
	
Session layer:-
	Establishment of connection (of processes), maintenance of session, authentication
	Allows process to add checkpoints into data
	Dialog controller
	
Presentation layer:-
	called translation layer as it converts data into required format(eg:- ASCII to EBCDIC)
	Encryption/Decryption
	Compression
	
Application layer
