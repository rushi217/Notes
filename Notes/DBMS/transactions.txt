A - Atomicity
C - Consistency
I - Isolation
D - Durability

Transaction states:-
	Active - executing instructions
	Partially commited - execution completed
	Commited - Database updated
	Failed - Failure occured while executing or updating database
	Aborted - Revert buffer to previous state using rollback
	
Dirty read:-
	Instead of reading from db, a transaction reads from local buffer
	This might lead to different values
	So commit after the transaction you copied from has already commited
	
Unrepeatable read:-
	Multiple reads give different values due to other transactions changing the values
	
Phantom read:-
	Other transaction deleted the value from buffer that i read previously
	
Lost Update Problem:-
	blind write is committed before other transaction
	other transaction commits the blind write output to the db as blind write changes the buffer
	
Schedule:-
	bundle of transactions
	Serial Schedule :- No concurrency
	Non serial :- Concurrency using preemption of operations
